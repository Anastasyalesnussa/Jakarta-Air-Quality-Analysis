# Jakarta Air Quality Analysis (2010‚Äì2025, excluding 2022)

This project analyzes over a decade of air quality data in Jakarta, Indonesia, focusing on major pollutants ‚Äî **PM2.5, PM10, SO‚ÇÇ, CO, O‚ÇÉ, and NO‚ÇÇ**.  
Using Python and Matplotlib, it explores pollution trends, emission patterns, and potential links to energy use and urbanization.

---

## Key Insights
- **PM2.5 and PM10** show consistent seasonal peaks during the dry season (June‚ÄìAugust).
- **SO‚ÇÇ and NO‚ÇÇ** concentrations indicate ongoing industrial and vehicular contributions.
- **O‚ÇÉ** levels fluctuate with sunlight intensity, showing photochemical smog activity.
- **CO** correlates with traffic density, especially in high-mobility months.
- The overall **urban AQI** remains above WHO guidelines for much of the year.

---

## Methods
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy  
- **Analysis:** Descriptive statistics, temporal trend visualization, correlation matrix  

---

## Sustainability Context
This project aims to support **data-driven emission reduction** and **urban energy transition** strategies by:
- Encouraging **renewable-based transport electrification**  
- Improving **industrial emission reporting**  
- Integrating **real-time AQI data** into environmental policymaking
