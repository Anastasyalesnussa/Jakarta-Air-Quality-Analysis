# Jakarta Air Quality Analysis (2010–2025, except 2022)

This project analyzes over a decade of air quality data in Jakarta, Indonesia, focusing on major pollutants — **PM2.5, PM10, SO₂, CO, O₃, and NO₂**.  
Using Python and Matplotlib, it explores pollution trends, emission patterns, and potential links to energy use and urbanization.

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- **PM2.5 and PM10** show consistent seasonal peaks during the dry season (June–August).
- **SO₂ and NO₂** concentrations indicate ongoing industrial and vehicular contributions.
- **O₃** levels fluctuate with sunlight intensity, showing photochemical smog activity.
- **CO** correlates with traffic density, especially in high-mobility months.
- The overall **urban AQI** remains above WHO guidelines for much of the year.

---

## 🔍 Methods
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy  
- **Analysis:** Descriptive statistics, temporal trend visualization, correlation matrix  

---

## 🌱 Sustainability Context
This project aims to support **data-driven emission reduction** and **urban energy transition** strategies by:
- Encouraging **renewable-based transport electrification**  
- Improving **industrial emission reporting**  
- Integrating **real-time AQI data** into environmental policymaking
